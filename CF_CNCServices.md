## Carbon Fiber sources and CNC Services
If you are planning to market your frames to the public then you will need to source your parts, frame kits and hardware from China.   You can find Carbon Fiber and CNC services on www.https://www.alibaba.com/ and FaceBook.com.  Do not waste your time contacting factories in China unless you are willing to purchase 20 frames or full sheets of parts, otherwise if you attempt to request a few parts or frames they will simply not respond and it will likely lead to you being ignored.   The typical methodology is to have a few proto-types cut using a local CNC service.  It's well worth making sure the design is solid before ordering 20-100 frames from China.  Once you establish a relationship with a factory and I recommend working with a minimum of 2 factories once you get things moving.  Why?  Because China has a tendency change prices or you may start to see a degradation in quality so you need to ensure you have a contingency plan in-place.  

## Prototypes:
If in the US, I have leveraged the following CNC Services for proto-types with great results:

## Production:
I have leveraged the following factories over the years with great results:

* Notes:One of the primary providers of T300 CF for many of the top frames in the business, but she can only provide T300 CF, so if you are in need of higher quality CF you have to go elsewhere, but her T300 quality fit/finish is the best in the business.

* Notes: Great source for T700, T800 Carbon Fiber.  This is the same factory that produces the AstroX frames with the slick coating etc.  You will pay a little more for their CF but the quality if very good.
