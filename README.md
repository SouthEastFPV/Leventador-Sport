# About Leventador Sport
## The idea
The Leventador Sport is the first super durable Box, open source collaborative race frame project. It empowers the community to integrate best practices and current trends into a continuously manufactured FPV Box Race frame. The durability, documentation and capability of this frame puts it on track to be one of the best Box racing frames for newcomers and professionals alike. This Frame was inspired by the Leventador Pro Race Frame and at the request of Mark Grohe (2DogRC) and Roger Bess who I have been racing with for years. Mark and Roger liked the Leventador Pro (a lighter version) but wanted something super durable.  I created this version specifically for them and it has proven to be insanely durable, more durable than many race frames on the market. It survived 12hrs of Mayhem without one broken carbon fiber part and I am not aware of any frame that has be able to do that. It's not the lightest coming in at 100g, as compared to the 74gr the Pro version, but if you are looking for frame that flies on rails and is near indestructible, this is one for you.

## Project naming requirements
Leventador Sport is the name of the frame.  If you are thinking about manufacturing it, you are expected to prefix the name with a brand name in order to allow customers to distinguish the different manufacturers, e.g. “SOUTHEAST LEVENTADOR SPORT”. As a manufacturer you are also expected to denote the version number of the frame files that you have used as basis of the project, e.g. “SOUTHEAST LEVENTADOR V1”. 
If you have forked the project, you need to give it another name in order to avoid confusion between LEVENTADOR SPORT and your project.
Accessories from the LEVENTADOR SPORT project also need to be named with the entire prefix, e.g. “SOUTHEAST LEVENTADOR FPV Camera Mount”. Unless the file is not compatible with certain versions of the frame, the compatible version number or version range also needs to be included in the name, e.g. “SOUTHEAST LEVENTADOR FPV Camera Mount V1 - V2”
